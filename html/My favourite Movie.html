	<li><a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Chicago-Med/0HOM5AA8C69VS6HYUS9BL505FL">Chicago Med</a>
		<p>Chicago med is very good. A series that will keep you very keen on knowing what's gonna happen to the main characters of the show every episode, their personal lifestyles and their professional careers.

	<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80176893">The Good Doctor</a>
		<p>I thought the show did a great job of portraying very unusual and interesting medical conditions and, at the same time, introducing us to the main cast of characters. The writers also did not shy away from difficult topics, handling homophobia, drug addiction, homelessness and corporate greed in the health-care system.</p>

	<li><a href="https://www.viki.com/tv/37580c-a-river-runs-through-it">A River Runs Through It</a>
		<p> It is a very thorough and meaningful drama that presents a long period of time in a thoughtful and clear way.</p>
